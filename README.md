## Why Use Speculate?

As a former benchtop chemist who transitioned into computational chemistry, I understand how daunting it can be to decode technical documentation or replicate computational workflows. The motivation for **Speculate** arose from my own challenges while working with **Titanium Catecholates**—a project requiring computational insights to address puzzling findings with limited literature data.

Speculate is designed for those like me: researchers who want to use computational methods to deepen their understanding without needing years of computational expertise. It’s a tool to help you focus on science rather than wrestling with unwieldy software setups.

Whether you're a student, a seasoned experimentalist venturing into computation, or a computational chemist seeking a more intuitive workflow, Speculate empowers you to bridge the gap between experiment and theory.
